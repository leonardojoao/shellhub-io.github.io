## Connecting to your device

ShellHub provides different connection methods:

* Web-based SSH client within the ShellHub UI (Chrome, Firefox)
* Traditional command line SSH client (Linux, Mac OS X)
* Any GUI SSH client like PuTTY (Windows)

Open the ShellHub UI at [http://localhost]() and sign in using the username and password
generated previously.

Once you are logged in, go to the _Device Fleet_ page ([http://localhost/devices](){target=_blank})
and follow instructions for a supported connection alternative:

### Web-based SSH client

In the _Device Fleet_ page, choose the device you wish to connect to and click on _Terminal_ icon
located at the *Actions* column on the chart.

A dialog will pop up prompting you for the username and password of an existing user on the
device's operating system. After providing credentials, click on _Connect_ button.

### Command line SSH client

To connect to your device using a command line SSH client, you need to know its SSHID address.

In the _Device Fleet_ page, choose the device you want to connect to and copy the device's SSHID
address clicking on _Copy_ icon located on SSHID address column of the chart.

Then, run the following command on your terminal:

```
ssh <USER>@<SSHID>
```

!!! note ""
    Make sure to replace `<USER>` with the existing user on the device's operating system and
    `<SSHID>` with the aforementioned SSHID address.

### PuTTY GUI SSH client

Connecting to your device using a GUI SSH client also requires its SSHID address.

In the _Device Fleet_ page, choose the device you want to connect to and copy the device's SSHID
address by clicking on the _Copy_ icon located at SSHID address column on the table.

Open Putty and fill in with the following information:

* Host Name (or IP address): `<USER>`@`<SSHID>`
* Port: 22
* Connection type: SSH

!!! note ""
    Make sure to replace `<USER>` with the existing user on the device's operating system and
    `<SSHID>` with the aforementioned SSHID address.
