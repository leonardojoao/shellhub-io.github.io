## Adding your first device

To add a device to ShellHub you need to install ShellHub Agent onto it.

The ShellHub Agent runs inside a Docker container. Make sure you have Docker
installed and properly set up.

Open a terminal on your device and then run the following commands to install the ShellHub agent:

```
curl "http://<SERVER_IP>/install.sh?tenant_id=<TENANT_ID>" | sh
```

!!! info ""
    Replace `<TENANT_ID>` with your _Tenant ID_ and
    `<SERVER_IP>` with the public IP address of the host running
    ShellHub.
